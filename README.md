# ADA442-FinalProject
A Machine Learning Project I have done with my 2 more group members for our Introduction to Statistical learning course. The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict
whether a client of a bank will subscribe to a term deposit or not. The dataset used for this project is the Bank Marketing Data Set, which can be found
at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing. Use the “bankadditional.csv” with 10% of the examples (4119), randomly selected from full dataset, and 20 inputs.
